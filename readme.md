#About this project

**This is a simple iOS application written in Swift that we used to run an introductory iOS development course [WellySwift](http://swift.hackpack.co.nz/)**

Please feel free to fork this repository and use it as a template to create your own iOS development course to run in your local community.

Once complete, we'll post all the resources from the course in this repository.

## A quick rundown

* Master contains the completed application. This should serve as a starting point to decide if you'd like to use this template.

* course/begin contains an empty application with the file structure we used for the course. This is what we installed on the students' desktops so they could get started straight away.

* We plan to add extension activites to this course. They'll be stored in branches off master named extra/**
